FIXME:
 - if we're not using ssl.wrap_socket, don't store the SSL object in the ircserver_ssl variable
 - the --quit option could be implemented better, the way it communicates to the currently active daemon

TODO:
 - close stdio during daemonization
 - add rate limiting and flood control, although the IRC server can be configured to handle most of this
 - accept messages from stdin
 - have a default channel listed in the config file for each identity
 - consume the rest of the command line args as part of the message
 - specify the nobody user name in the config file
